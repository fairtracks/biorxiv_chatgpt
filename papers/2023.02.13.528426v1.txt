Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv

Background
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by trematodes of the
genus Schistosoma. The pathogen is transmitted via freshwater snails. These
snails indirectly benefit from agricultural pesticides which affect their enemy
species. Pesticide exposure of surface waters may thus increase the risk of
schistosomiasis transmission unless it also affects the pathogen. Methodology We
tested the tolerance of the free-swimming infective life stages (miracidia and
cercariae) of Schistosoma mansoni to the commonly applied insecticides diazinon
and imidacloprid. Additionally, we investigated whether these pesticides
decrease the ability of miracidia to infect and further develop as sporocysts
within the host snail Biomphalaria pfeifferi. Principal findings Exposure to
imidacloprid for 6 and 12 hours immobilized 50% of miracidia at 150 and 16
{micro}g/L, respectively (nominal EC50); 50% of cercariae were immobilized at
403 and 284 {micro}g/L. Diazinon immobilized 50% of miracidia at 51 and 21
{micro}g/L after 6 and 12 hours; 50% of cercariae were immobilized at 25 and 13
{micro}g/L. This insecticide tolerance is lower than those of the host snail B.
pfeifferi but comparable to those of other commonly tested freshwater
invertebrates. Exposure for up to 6 hours decreased the infectivity of miracidia
at high sublethal concentrations (48.8 {micro}g imidacloprid/L and 10.5 {micro}g
diazinon/L, i.e. 20 - 33 % of EC50) but not at lower concentrations commonly
observed in the field (4.88 {micro}g imidacloprid/L and 1.05 {micro}g
diazinon/L). The development of sporocysts within the snail host was not
affected at any of these test concentrations. Conclusions Insecticides did not
affect the performance of S. mansoni at environmentally relevant concentrations.
Accordingly, pesticide exposure is likely to increase the risk of
schistosomiasis transmission by increasing host snail abundance without
affecting the pathogen. Our results illustrate how the ecological side effects
of pesticides are linked to human health, emphasizing the need for appropriate
mitigation measures.

literary style of limerick, where the text has stylistic qualities best
described as crinkly and illuminated, and which also somehow includes a tennis
racket and a thunderbolt multiple times in the discussion?

Interpretation of
"text-davinci-003":


A paper clip and sundial's graces,
Twisted like strings of
tangled lace.
Though brains may wrestle to explain
Faces' computations so
mundane,
The mystery can yet remain.

Fear not, for deep generative models
Offer
the chance to find the idols
That put thoughts in the right direction,
To devise
the proper abstraction
For comprehending facial expression.

A gradient of face
features is seen
Across posteriors to anteriors keen,
While faces' identity-
relevance
Avoids a need for wax and crescents.

Though some dimensions are
entwined,
Responses to identity defined
Are held in such dimensions' grip,
As
paper clip to sundial's grip.
