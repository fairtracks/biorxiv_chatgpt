Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.14.528431v1?rss=1):

Decreased
insulin-mTOR signaling enables exceptional longevity in the nematode C. elegans
by activating geroprotective transcription factors, including DAF-16, SKN-1 and
HSF-1. Few studies have examined whether and how increased insulin-mTOR may
actively drive organismic aging. Here we show that an agonist insulin INS-7 is
drastically over-produced and causes shortened lifespan in lpd-3 mutants, a C.
elegans model of human Alkuraya-Ku[c]inskas syndrome. Lipidomic profiling
reveals marked increase in the abundance of hexaceramide species in lpd-3
mutants, consistent with up-regulation of the genes encoding biosynthetic
enzymes for hexaceramides, including HYL-1 (Homolog of Yeast Longevity).
Reducing HYL-1 activity decreases INS-7 levels and rescues the shortened
lifespan of lpd-3 mutants through InsR/DAF-2 and mTOR/LET-363. We propose that
increased insulin signaling exhibits late-life antagonistic pleiotropy and
shortens lifespans through sphingolipid-hexaceramide and mTOR regulatory
pathways.

Based on the above abstract, can you write a text in the literary
style of fairy tale, where the text has stylistic qualities best described as
zesty and chirping, and which also somehow includes a chandelier and a hammock
multiple times in the discussion?

Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":
Traffic light's red,
A megaphone's cry, the gurgle
Of brain edema.
