Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.14.528582v1?rss=1):

The neural
and computational mechanisms underlying visual motion perception have been
extensively investigated over several decades, but most studies have used simple
artificial stimuli such as random-dot kinematograms. Thus, it remains difficult
to predict how human observers perceive optical flows in complex natural scenes.
Here, we report a novel method to measure, psychophysically, optical flows
perceived by human observers watching naturalistic movies, and to reveal the
characteristics of human motion perception via comparison of the measured
perceived flow to the ground truths and model predictions. We selected movie
clips from the MPI Sintel Flow Dataset, which contains open-source computer
graphics animations with ground truths. To measure the perceived vectors at a
spatiotemporal point, we flashed a small dot during presentation of a brief clip
and asked the observers to adjust the speed and direction of a matching random-
noise stimulus, to reproduce the vector at the flashed point. The proposed
method adequately estimated perceived flow, and the estimated perceived vector
also indicated flow illusions, i.e., consistent deviations from the ground
truths, in various ways, depending on the stimulus patterns. Comparisons with
the predictions of biologically motivated models and machine vision algorithms
indicated that some flow illusions were attributable to lower-level factors such
as spatiotemporal pooling and signal loss, but others reflected higher-level
computations including coordinate transformations that cannot be precisely
predicted by existing flow estimation models. Psychophysical measurement of the
optical flows that humans perceive in realistic environments constitutes a
promising paradigm for advancing our understanding of visual motion perception.
Based on the above abstract, can you write a text in the literary style of
folklore, where the text has stylistic qualities best described as wobbling and
jagged, and which also somehow includes a jellyfish and a trombone multiple
times in the discussion?

Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


There once was
a pinwheel that rustled,
It felt as bumpy as a wristwatch;
It spun so quick with
its own gusts,
That it studied the microbes in the dust
And used a Vulture to
make its own batch.
