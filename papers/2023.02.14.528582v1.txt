Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.14.528582v1?rss=1):

The neural
and computational mechanisms underlying visual motion perception have been
extensively investigated over several decades, but most studies have used simple
artificial stimuli such as random-dot kinematograms. Thus, it remains difficult
to predict how human observers perceive optical flows in complex natural scenes.
Here, we report a novel method to measure, psychophysically, optical flows
perceived by human observers watching naturalistic movies, and to reveal the
characteristics of human motion perception via comparison of the measured
perceived flow to the ground truths and model predictions. We selected movie
clips from the MPI Sintel Flow Dataset, which contains open-source computer
graphics animations with ground truths. To measure the perceived vectors at a
spatiotemporal point, we flashed a small dot during presentation of a brief clip
and asked the observers to adjust the speed and direction of a matching random-
noise stimulus, to reproduce the vector at the flashed point. The proposed
method adequately estimated perceived flow, and the estimated perceived vector
also indicated flow illusions, i.e., consistent deviations from the ground
truths, in various ways, depending on the stimulus patterns. Comparisons with
the predictions of biologically motivated models and machine vision algorithms
indicated that some flow illusions were attributable to lower-level factors such
as spatiotemporal pooling and signal loss, but others reflected higher-level
computations including coordinate transformations that cannot be precisely
predicted by existing flow estimation models. Psychophysical measurement of the
optical flows that humans perceive in realistic environments constitutes a
promising paradigm for advancing our understanding of visual motion perception.
Based on the above abstract, can you write a text in the literary style of myth,
where the text has stylistic qualities best described as wavy and flimsy, and
which also somehow includes a hairbrush and a barometer multiple times in the
discussion?

Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


Once upon a time, deep in
the heart of the kingdom, the ancient and powerful Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) TF
glowed with a smoldering intensity, quietly chirping its way through the
darkness. This mysterious force bound both neuron-type-specific and pan-neuronal
gene expression, controlling global components of the nervous system. Despite
its awesome power, a single, solitary teardrop could be seen trickling down its
face, representing its profound sadness over the lack of understanding of its
true capabilities.

The darkness was shattered, however, by the heroic efforts
of a brave band of researchers, each armed with a lone flashlight in search of
the truth. Shining their lights on NF-Y's targets, they discovered direct
binding to cis-regulatory regions, illuminating the path of how it controlled
pan-neuronal gene expression. With further investigation, they uncovered
NFYA-1's role in regulating the expression of terminal selector TFs, leading to
its influence on neuronal activity and motor function. 

And so, this long-
forgotten secret was revealed, letting loose a collective sigh of understanding.
NF-Y glowed with a newfound glory and its teardrop glittered in the light of the
many flashlights, a sign of its newfound power. The nervous system, thought to
be so complex, was to be understood at last and all of the kingdom rejoiced.
