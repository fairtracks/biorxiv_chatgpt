Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.13.526554v1?rss=1):

Spatial
transcriptomics (ST) techniques are able to chart the distribution and
localization of cell types and RNA molecules across a tissue. Sequencing-based
methods allow unbiased capturing of RNA molecules at barcoded spots. While the
coarse resolution of these techniquee is considered a disadvantage, we argue
that the inherent proximity of transcriptomes captured on spots can be leveraged
to reconstruct cellular networks. To this end, we developed ISCHIA (Identifying
Spatial Co-occurrence in Healthy and InflAmed tissues), a computational
framework to analyze the spatial co-occurrence of cell types and transcript
species in the tissue environment. Co-occurrence analysis is complementary to
differential gene expression, as it does not depend on the abundance of a given
cell type or the transcript expression levels, but rather on their spatial
arrangement in the tissue. We applied ISCHIA to analyze co-occurrence of cell
types, ligands and receptors in a sequencing-based ST dataset of human
ulcerative colitis, and validated our findings on matched hybridization-based
data. We uncover inflammation-induced cellular networks involving M-cell and
fibroblasts, as well as ligand-receptor interactions enriched in the inflamed
human colon, and their associated gene signatures. Our results highlight the
hypothesis-generating power and broad applicability of co-occurrence analysis on
spatial transcriptomics data.

Based on the above abstract, can you write a text
in the literary style of tragedy, where the text has stylistic qualities best
described as thunderous and crispy, and which also somehow includes a helicopter
and a kite multiple times in the discussion?

Interpretation of "text-
davinci-003":


Once was a thunderbolt with a clap
That brought agricultural
pesticide to a snap
The larvae of trematodes were quite bothered
For these
pesticides changed the ecology of freshwater ponds like a rotten potato
The
species of Schistosoma increased as the host snails were quite free
Exempt from
predation and pesticide's fee
The danger was high for human health
So the tools
to mitigate were shown with a stealth
Like a tennis racket wielded with might
The hope is that schistosomiasis can be put to flight.
