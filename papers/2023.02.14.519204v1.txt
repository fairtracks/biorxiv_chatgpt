Recently
multi-voxel pattern analysis has verified the removal of information from
working memory (WM) via three distinct operations replacement, suppression, or
clearing compared to information being maintained (Kim et al., 2020). Univariate
analyses and classifier importance maps indicate that some brain regions
commonly contribute to these operations. This study aimed to use multivariate
approaches to determine whether, within these commonly activated brain regions,
each of these operations is being represented in a similar or distinct manner.
To do so, we used Leiden community detection to identify brain networks that are
characterized by similar multi-voxel patterns of activity with regard to these
WM operations. Four networks were identified. The Visual Network shows similar
multi-voxel patterns for maintain and replace, which are highly dissimilar from
suppress and clear, suggesting this network differentiates whether an item is
held in WM or not. The Somatomotor Network shows distinct multi-voxel patterns
for clear relative to the other operations, suggesting that this network diff in
clearing information from WM. The Default Mode Network has distinct patterns for
suppress and clear, also suggesting that clearing information from WM is
distinct from suppressing it. The Frontoparietal Control Network displays
distinct multi-voxel patterns for each of the four operations, suggesting that
this network has high involvement in regulating the flow of information within
WM. These results indicate that how information is removed from WM depends on
distinct brain networks that each have a particular manner in which their co-
activation patterns represent these operations.

stylistic qualities best described as quivering and spinning, and which also
somehow includes a dandelion and a jellyfish multiple times in the discussion?
Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


The darkness stretched out before me
like an oppressive blanket, silencing the world. I could barely hear the sound
of my own breath as I slowly made my way through the pitch-black night. My
flashlight, the only source of light, bounced off the edges of the path, casting
eerie shadows that followed me like the eyes of a beast.

Suddenly, something
cracked in the darkness and I was filled with dread. I shone my flashlight
around wildly and there, in front of me, was a seashell. I had never seen
anything like it before. It seemed unearthly and sinister. I shivered as I
reached out to pick it up and peered into its depths.

My heart stopped. Inside
the seashell was something almost unrecognizable: a jumble of organic looking
shapes that I realized with a start were some kind of pathways. They looked
almost alive, writhing and pulsing like some kind of nightmare creature. I
dropped the seashell with a gasp and stumbled backward, my breath coming in
ragged gasps. 

I had stumbled upon something truly horrifying: a tool to
evaluate the bioenergetic feasibility of alternative metabolic pathways,
optimising their energy yield and driving forces as a function of the
concentration of metabolic intermediates. As if being in the dark wasn't
frightening enough, I now knew that something sinister lay just beyond my reach,
lurking in the shadows like a monster.

I cursed myself for being so brave, for
straying so far from the path and venturing into the unknown. I stumbled away,
my flashlight still trembling in my hand, and vowed never to return.
