Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.13.528395v1?rss=1):

kakapo
(k[a]k[a]p[o]) is a python-based pipeline that allows users to extract and
assemble one or more specified genes or gene families. It flexibly uses original
RNA-seq read or GenBank SRA accession inputs without performing assembly of
entire transcriptomes. The pipeline identifies open reading frames in the
assembled gene transcripts and annotates them. It optionally filters raw reads
for ribosomal, plastid, and mitochondrial reads, or reads belonging to non-
target organisms (e.g., viral, bacterial, human). kakapo can be employed to
extract arbitrary loci, such as those commonly used for phylogenetic inference
in systematics or candidate genes and gene families in phylogenomic and
metagenomic studies. We provide example applications and discuss how its use can
offset the declining value of the GenBank's single-gene databases and help
assemble datasets for a variety of phylogenetic analyses.

Based on the above
abstract, can you write a text in the literary style of lyric, where the text
has stylistic qualities best described as quivering and sparkling, and which
also somehow includes a lighthouse and a thunderbolt multiple times in the
discussion?

Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


The sun shone brightly over
the old town, silhouetting its windmills and lighthouses in the warm summer
breeze. In the distance, a small group of scholars could be seen clustered
around a table, discussing the implications of their recent findings.

"We have
unlocked the secrets of neoantigen-based immunotherapy," said one of the
scholars. "By creating NeoTCR, a unified database containing neoantigen-specific
TCR sequences, we have bridged the gap between the clinical and the lab."

The
other scholars nodded in agreement, their eyes blinking and hissing as they
tried to keep up with the conversation.

"NeoTCR provides access to the
scattered information on neoantigens and their associated TCRs," said another.
"It not only helps researchers easily identify neoantigen-specific TCRs from raw
sequencing data, it also enables us to hone in on the biological functions of
such neoantigen-associated T-cells in anti-tumor immunity, paving the way for
future treatments to be developed."

The group looked over at the old windmill
and lighthouse, their silhouettes seeming to grow ever larger in the distance as
the sun slowly descended.

"This is a remarkable achievement," said the first
scholar. "By harnessing the power of the windmill and the lighthouse, we can
turn NeoTCR into a beacon of hope, a lighthouse in the night."

The scholars
looked out across the town, and the windmill and lighthouse, knowing that they
had created something special, something that could help millions of people
around the world.
