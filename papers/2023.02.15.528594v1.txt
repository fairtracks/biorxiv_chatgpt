Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.15.528594v1?rss=1):

Epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central oncogenic mechanism, contributing both
to transformation and metastatic dissemination. Inflammation and innate immune
cells are known to favor EMT induction, but the role of adaptive immunity still
remains unclear. Using an original murine mammary tumor model in immune cell
subpopulation depletion experiments, we demonstrated that tumor cells maintain
their epithelial phenotype in mice deficient for adaptive immune response, but
undergo EMT in the presence of T-cells. This phenotypic conversion involves the
major contribution of CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells nor B cells, undoubtedly
demonstrating the pro-EMT role of CD4 T cells specifically among adaptive immune
cells. Moreover, combined intra-tumor immune infiltrate and transcriptomic
analyses of murine mammary tumors with various EMT phenotype revealed an inverse
correlation between mesenchymal tumor cell and intratumoral neutrophil
proportions, due to the reduced ability of mesenchymal cells to recruit
neutrophils. Last, selective in vivo depletion of neutrophils and transcriptomic
analysis of human breast tumor cohorts demonstrated the pro-EMT role of
neutrophils and suggest a cooperation with CD4 T cells in EMT promotion.
Collectively, our data highlight a novel mechanism of EMT regulation by both
innate and adaptive immune compartments.

Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


Once upon a time, in a laboratory deep
within a distant eldritch realm, a group of scientists made an incredible
discovery. They discovered that in the simple, unassuming nematode C. elegans,
the level of insulin-mTOR signalling could have a powerful effect on the
longevity of the organism.

In examining the consequences of increased insulin-
mTOR signalling, the scientists found that too much of the hormone INS-7 could
shorten the lifespan of a mutant strain called lpd-3. In looking for an
explanation for this phenomenon, the scientists discerned an increase in
hexaceramide species. Further inquiry revealed that this rise was due the
activity of the gene HYL-1. 

The scientists then reversed the process -
reducing the activity of HYL-1 decreased the INS-7 levels and restored the
shortened lifespans of the lpd-3 mutants. This, the scientists concluded, was
through the InsR/DAF-2 and mTOR/LET-363 pathways.

The riddle was solved, and
the scientists concluded that increased insulin signaling could have a
detrimental effect on lifespan. As the elated scientists celebrated, their
chandeliers and hammocks swung merrily in the background, heralding a new and
zesty future for longevity research.
