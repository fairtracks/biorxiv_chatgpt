Here follows the abstract of a scientific paper recently published atbioRxiv
(http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.02.15.528594v1?rss=1):

Epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central oncogenic mechanism, contributing both
to transformation and metastatic dissemination. Inflammation and innate immune
cells are known to favor EMT induction, but the role of adaptive immunity still
remains unclear. Using an original murine mammary tumor model in immune cell
subpopulation depletion experiments, we demonstrated that tumor cells maintain
their epithelial phenotype in mice deficient for adaptive immune response, but
undergo EMT in the presence of T-cells. This phenotypic conversion involves the
major contribution of CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells nor B cells, undoubtedly
demonstrating the pro-EMT role of CD4 T cells specifically among adaptive immune
cells. Moreover, combined intra-tumor immune infiltrate and transcriptomic
analyses of murine mammary tumors with various EMT phenotype revealed an inverse
correlation between mesenchymal tumor cell and intratumoral neutrophil
proportions, due to the reduced ability of mesenchymal cells to recruit
neutrophils. Last, selective in vivo depletion of neutrophils and transcriptomic
analysis of human breast tumor cohorts demonstrated the pro-EMT role of
neutrophils and suggest a cooperation with CD4 T cells in EMT promotion.
Collectively, our data highlight a novel mechanism of EMT regulation by both
innate and adaptive immune compartments.

Based on the above abstract, can you
write a text in the literary style of limerick, where the text has stylistic
qualities best described as jagged and inflatable, and which also somehow
includes a lighthouse and a harmonica multiple times in the discussion?
Interpretation of "text-davinci-003":


There once was a light so grand, 
A
lighthouse inside a harmonica band.
It helped guide our way, 
To show us the
way,
As neutrophils enhanced the EMT so grand.

CD4 T-cells a major role did
play,
So EMT did bloom and bloom in a way,
It was good and it was bad,
It was
still kinda sad,
And the lighthouse and harmonica did sway.
